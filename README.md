## Summary

The **Fairphone First Edition Launcher** was the default launcher in the official operating system for the Fairphone 1, based on Android 4.2 "Jelly Bean". The launcher was superseded by the [Fairphone Launcher 3][wearefairphone-fplauncher3] in 2015 with the release of the Fairphone 2 model.

The Fairphone 1 apps were designed by [Kwamecorp][kwamecorp] and released as open source software. The [WeAreFairphone community][wearefairphone] makes them available for those users who want to keep the original [Fairphone experience][fairphone-experience].

You may want to take a look at Fairphone's [Recent Contacts][wearefairphone-mycontacts] and [Clock][wearefairphone-clock] widgets too.

## Features

**Edge Swipe** makes it possible to quickly access frequently used apps with just a swipe of the finger from the left or right side of the screen towards the center, and then release it on the desired app. With this feature you can keep your home screen clean and tidy, and only access your important apps when you need to see them.
