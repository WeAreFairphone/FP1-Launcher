The <strong>Fairphone First Edition Launcher</strong> was the default launcher in the official operating system for the Fairphone 1, based on Android 4.2 "Jelly Bean". The launcher was superseded by the <a href="https://f-droid.org/packages/community.fairphone.fplauncher3">Fairphone Launcher 3</a> in 2015 with the release of the Fairphone 2 model.

The Fairphone 1 apps were designed by Kwamecorp and released as open source software. The WeAreFairphone community makes them available for those users who want to keep the original Fairphone experience.
